# Tax Calculator Improvements - October 2025

## Overview

This document summarizes all improvements, bug fixes, and enhancements made to the TaxEasy ZA 2025 Tax Calculator application to ensure SARS compliance and improve user experience.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Tooltip Functionality ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Tooltips were not displaying when hovering over help icons.

**Root Causes**:
- Missing `tax-helpers.js` file causing initialization failure
- Tooltip positioning using `position: absolute` instead of `position: fixed`
- Duplicate CSS definitions causing conflicts
- Script loading order issues

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Created `/js/tax-helpers.js` with utility functions
- Changed tooltip positioning to `fixed` for proper viewport positioning
- Removed duplicate CSS definitions from `styles.css`
- Fixed script loading order in `index.html`
- Removed duplicate initialization code

**Result**: Tooltips now display correctly with proper positioning near the cursor.

### 2. Persistent Error Messages ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Application showed persistent error message on load.

**Root Causes**:
- Missing `tax-helpers.js` file
- Syntax errors in `wizard-navigation.js` (optional chaining operators `?.`)
- Duplicate `DOMContentLoaded` listeners calling initialization twice

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Created missing `tax-helpers.js` file
- Removed all optional chaining operators (`?.`) and replaced with safe null-checking
- Removed duplicate initialization from `index.html`
- Improved error handling to show specific error messages

**Result**: Application loads cleanly without any error messages.

### 3. Travel Allowance Deduction Section ✅ ENHANCED
**Problem**: Travel allowance deduction method selection didn't show dynamic fields or guidance.

**Root Cause**:
- Event listener using `input` event instead of `change` event for `<select>` elements
- Dynamic fields not appearing when deduction method changed

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Added proper `change` event listener for travel method dropdown
- Created dedicated `handleTravelMethodChange()` function
- Implemented dynamic field visibility:
  - "Deemed Rate" → Shows Business Kilometers field
  - "Actual Cost" → Shows Actual Travel Expenses field
  - "Fully Taxable" → Hides additional fields
- Added dynamic guidance text that updates based on selected method
- All guidance emphasizes SARS compliance requirements

**Result**: Travel allowance section now provides clear, dynamic instructions and shows appropriate fields based on user selection.

### 4. Navigation System ✅ VERIFIED
**Problem**: Potential navigation issues between wizard steps.

**Testing Results**:
- ✅ Previous/Next buttons work correctly
- ✅ Step indicator navigation functional
- ✅ Form data persists during navigation
- ✅ Visual feedback clear and intuitive
- ✅ Validation prevents progression with incomplete data

**Result**: Navigation system is fully functional with no issues found.

### 5. SARS Compliance ✅ VERIFIED & CORRECTED
**Problem**: Tax calculations needed verification against official 2025 SARS tables.

**Verification Completed**:
- ✅ Tax brackets verified against official SARS website
- ✅ Tax rebates confirmed (R17,235 primary, R9,444 secondary, R3,145 tertiary)
- ✅ Tax thresholds confirmed (R95,750, R148,217, R165,689)
- ✅ Medical aid tax credits confirmed (R364 main member, R246 dependant per month)
- ✅ Travel allowance rate confirmed (R4.76/km for 2025)

**Critical Error Found and Fixed**:
- **Bracket 4 Issue**: Upper limit was R673,100 (should be R673,000)
- **Cumulative Tax Error**: Was R121,424 (should be R121,475)
- **Impact**: R51 undercalculation for incomes R512,801 - R1,817,000+
- **Fix Applied**: Corrected all three age group brackets in `tax-constants.js`

**Result**: All tax constants are now 100% SARS compliant for the 2025 tax year.

## Files Modified

| File | Changes Made |
|------|--------------|
| `js/tax-helpers.js` | **Created** - Utility functions for tax calculations |
| `js/tooltip-system.js` | Fixed positioning from `absolute` to `fixed` |
| `js/wizard-navigation.js` | Removed optional chaining operators, added safety checks |
| `js/main.js` | Added travel method change handler, fixed duplicate init |
| `js/tax-constants.js` | **Critical**: Fixed bracket 4 cumulative from 121424 to 121475 |
| `css/styles.css` | Removed duplicate tooltip CSS definitions |
| `index.html` | Fixed script loading order, removed duplicate initialization |

## Technical Details

### Tax Bracket Correction

**Before (Incorrect)**:
```javascript
{ min: 512801, max: 673100, rate: 0.36, cumulative: 121424 }
```

**After (Correct)**:
```javascript
{ min: 512801, max: 673000, rate: 0.36, cumulative: 121475 }
```

**Calculation Verification**:
- Tax on first R237,100 = R237,100 × 18% = R42,678
- Tax on R237,101 - R370,500 = R133,400 × 26% = R34,684
- Tax on R370,501 - R512,800 = R142,300 × 31% = R44,113
- **Total cumulative = R42,678 + R34,684 + R44,113 = R121,475** ✓

### Travel Allowance Enhancement

**Dynamic Guidance Messages**:

1. **Fully Taxable**: "If you receive a travel allowance but do not use your private vehicle for business purposes, or do not keep a logbook, the full allowance will be taxed. No deduction can be claimed."

2. **Deemed Rate**: "This method uses SARS-prescribed rates per kilometer for business travel. You MUST keep a detailed logbook to claim this deduction. The non-taxable portion is calculated based on your business kilometers."

3. **Actual Cost**: "This method allows you to claim actual costs incurred for business travel. You MUST keep a detailed logbook and all receipts for fuel, maintenance, insurance, and depreciation."

## Testing Performed

### Functional Testing

**Income**: R600,000 annual salary  
**Expected Tax**: R135,632  
**Calculated Tax**: R135,632 (after fix applied)  
**Status**: ✅ CORRECT

## Known Limitations

### Browser Caching
Due to browser/server caching, users may need to perform a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R) to see the latest changes, particularly the corrected tax constants.

**Recommended Solutions**:
- Clear browser cache
- Restart HTTP server
- Implement cache-busting headers
- Use versioned filenames for JavaScript files
